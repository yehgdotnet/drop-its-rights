# drop-its-rights
DropItsRights is a wrapper implementation of DropMyRights program by Michael Howard featured at MSDN.

The DropMyRights program puts burden to us because it supports only command line.

So, I tweaked it as parameter support and shell extension tweak that allow you to right-click on desired executable or its shortcut that is to be executed with DropMyRights.

The original DropMyRights was recompiled and insecure functions such as wcsncat were replaced with their secure versions. Source code included.

Platform: Windows 2K/2K3/XP
